### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

- They prepare me a lot for the project, especially the HTML and CSS topics.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
- I would've focused more on functionality, I underestimated the difficulty of Javascript.
  
* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

- I  need to work on my time management skills in oder to complete all the milestone
